Description for website:

A collection of 4,000 Meta Hamsters
Meta Hamsters is a community-driven collectibles NFT project. Each Meta Hamsters NFTs is uniquely generated with exciting traits of faces, hair, hats, body and backgrounds. 
Each Doodle is a unique, non-fungible token (NFT) on the Solana blockchain.

Holding a Meta Hamsters allows you to participate in coordinating the Meta Hamsters Community SandBox Land and Future of the project. 
This Land will be devleoped after the public sale ends! Holders can vote for experiences, activations, games and campaigns that benefit the Meta Hamsters.

The road map for Meta Hmasters is collaborative and engaging. With imaginative ideas, adequate resources and coordination, we believe we can bring Meta Hamsters to show the culture about the Solana Blockchain

The Meta Hamsters public sales opens on Saturday, January 15th, 8pm EST.
